<h1>Stock Price Updater</h1>

<p1>This is a python script which will monitor the prices of stocks and send an email to the specified email address when the price target has been reached</p1>


<p1>This uses webscraping by directing to NASDAQ's website and scraping the price of the specified stock. Then once the target stock price has been hit, the script will send an email to you using SMTP protocol.</p1>
<h3>Currently the program does not work as intended due to changes in the gmail API which kind of breaks sending emails using SMTP. I will be fixing this in the near future.</h3>
